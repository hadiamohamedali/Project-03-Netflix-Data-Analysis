# 📺 Netflix Dataset Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Netflix movies and TV shows data using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.
The goal is to explore content types, genres, countries, release trends, ratings, and duration through **comprehensive visualizations**.

## 📂 Dataset

**File:** `netflix_titles.csv`

**Columns include:**

* `show_id` – unique identifier
* `type` – Movie or TV Show
* `title` – title of content
* `director`
* `cast`
* `country`
* `date_added` – date added to Netflix
* `release_year`
* `rating`
* `duration` – minutes for movies / seasons for TV shows
* `listed_in` – genres
* `description`

## 🧰 Libraries Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## 🔹 Data Cleaning Steps

1. Checked data shape, duplicates, missing values.
2. Filled missing categorical columns (`director`, `cast`, `country`, `rating`) with `'Unknown'`.
3. Converted `date_added` to **datetime** and replaced invalid/missing values with earliest date.
4. Cleaned `show_id` to integer values.
5. Extracted numerical `Duration` for Movies and TV Shows.
6. Created new columns: `Year_added`, `Month_added`.
7. Converted categorical columns to `category` type for easier analysis.
8. Ensured `Genres` column is ready for splitting and counting multiple genres.
